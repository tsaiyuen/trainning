# An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike 
# that took exactly "steps" steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill,"U" ,
# or a downhill, "D" step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step
# up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude. We define the following
# terms:
# Function Description
# Complete the counting_hills function in the editor below.
# counting_hills has the following parameter(s):
# int steps: the number of steps on the hike
# string path: a string describing the path
# Returns
# int: the number of valleys traversed
# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer "steps", the number of steps in the hike.
# The second line contains a single string "path", of "steps" characters that describe
# the path.

# UDDDUDUU
# output = 1
